## About me
I've always been a nerd. I graduated with a master science degree in Mechatronics Design. It wasn't exactly a rocket science... Actually it was! One of the highlights of my studies is a sounding rocket launch campaign.


So far I've been mostly focusing on learning robotics and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles / drones). In 2013 I defendend my Bachelor's thesis on *Software and Hardware design of quadrocopter model*, in 2014 I wrote a thesis on *3D mapping payload for UAV applications*, where I worked with ardupilot, Hokuyo laser rangefinder and ROS to implement **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

Between 2014 and 2016 I was working at [SkyCircuits](http://www.skycircuits.com) where I was writing ground control station software for UAV autopilots and even led an autopilot integration project on 50kg+ helicopter platform.

## What are you going to find on this blog
Short answer: everything.
A bit longer answer: I'm a very keen learner. I study lots of different topics at different times. When I find something interesting I'm likely to share it on this blog. Stay tuned for more information!
