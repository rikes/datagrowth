In December 2015 a colleague of mine [Artur Skowroński](https://medium.com/@ArturSkowronski) presented me his idea of a new year's resolution in which you read 12 technical books in one year.

<!-- more -->

Yes! I loved the idea and decided to do my best to complete the challenge.
The idea grew quite rapidly, each of us set up a trello board with his selection of books. My selection of books constantly changes and the pile of shame is in the state of constant growth.

## The list
As of writing this post (March 2016) the list have the following titles in 4 categories:

1. Completed books

  * Microsoft Visual C# 2013 Step By Step
  * Code Complete


2. In progress:
  * Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python


3. Big 12 (Books currently selected for being read this year):
C# In Depth
  * Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
  * Don’t Make Me Think
  * Dependency Injection in .Net
  * Pro Git
  * Concurrency in C# Cookbook
  * Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
  * F#
  * Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture


4. Pile of shame (books that I’m highly unlikely to read this year):
  * The Pragmatic Programmer
  * The Mythicla Man-Month
  * Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#
  * Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests
  * CLR via C#
  * The Design of Everyday Things
  * Rapid Development
  * Real-World Functional Programming
  * Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
  * About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design
  * Understanding Space: An Introduction
  * Programming Pearls
  * The Art of Software Testing
