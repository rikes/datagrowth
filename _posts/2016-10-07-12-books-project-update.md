Over 10 months ago I decided to take part in a 12 books challenge. So far I finished 4 books and I’m hoping to finish 1 or 2 more. The fact is that **I won’t read 12 technical books this year** but that’s OK.

<!-- more -->

### Going through changes

If you take a look at my original list of books you will see that all the books but two (Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python and The Design of Everyday Things) are heavily related to high level software development. Currently I’m in the process of shifting my career focus. In December 2015 my plan was to master C#, become a .NET agile wizard ninja and keep working on UAV interfaces.

Over the past few months my career interests started shifting more towards core robotics development and embedded programming. Just last month I left [SkyCircuits](https://www.skycircuits.com/) and as of next month I will start working in France (more details coming soon!)

### What now?
So my [trello board](https://trello.com/b/2GstvyIq/12books) definitely needs some updating. Over the next days I will be going through internet looking for robotics and embedded programming literature and keep working hard to cover at least 2 more books this year.

### I regret nothing!
Just to be clear, I’m super happy with my original choice of books. I will definitely come back to the original books as I’m sure those books would make me a far better engineer. I’m especially happy that I learned so much C# and I’m planning to keep using it for my personal projects.
