For the first time in my life I created a game playing bot (in this case Bejeweled 3). I did it so that you don’t have to spend significant part of your life playing it. Also I had some fun working on it and I wanted to see if I can actually pull it off. And I did!

What you can see below is the first working prototype, after I finish refactoring it I will write a series of posts on the prototype and then give you a link to my repo so you can also play a bit.

In the next post I will show you how I’m doing the screen scrapping part of the bot and how am I identifying tiles/gems. After that the posts will cover the move decision algorithm and handling mouse and keyboard input.

Stay tuned!
